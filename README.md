# wg2awg

`wg2awg` is a lightweight UDP proxy that converts packet format between
standard WireGuard and AmneziaWG.

It is designed for routers that already have a WireGuard client,
but need AmneziaWG-compatible packet framing
and obfuscation to reach remote AWG servers.

The proxy does not implement VPN encryption itself.
WireGuard encryption stays in WireGuard peers.
`wg2awg` only transforms packet type fields, padding,
and junk/CPS traffic patterns.

wg2awg is derived from amneziawg-mikrotik-c by timbrs:
<https://github.com/timbrs/amneziawg-mikrotik-c>

## Scope

* Runtime target: Linux.
* Transport: UDP over IPv4 and IPv6.
* Modes: `client`, `gateway`, `server`.
* Protocol profiles: AWG v1, v1.5, v2.

## What Problems It Solves

* Connect WireGuard-only routers to AmneziaWG servers.
* Build site-to-site flows with AWG framing on the public side.
* Aggregate multiple AWG clients into a single WireGuard backend in hub mode.

## Architecture

### End-to-End Topology (proxy on both sides)

This is the most universal layout when both edges run plain WireGuard stacks,
but the transport path between them must look like AWG traffic.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  WGA[Site A WireGuard] -->|WG UDP| PA[wg2awg client]
  PA -->|AWG UDP| PB[wg2awg gateway or server]
  PB -->|WG UDP| WGB[Site B WireGuard]
  WGB -->|WG UDP| PB
  PB -->|AWG UDP| PA
  PA -->|WG UDP| WGA
```

With this pattern you keep native WireGuard on both ends
and move AWG framing logic to dedicated proxy processes.

### Client Mode (`AWG_MODE=client`, default)

Use when your router has a local WireGuard client and a remote AWG server.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  R[Router WireGuard client] -->|WG UDP| P[wg2awg client]
  P -->|AWG UDP| S[Remote AWG server]
  S -->|AWG UDP| P
  P -->|WG UDP| R
```

Client mode (`AWG_MODE=client`) is the WG -> AWG direction at egress
and AWG -> WG on return.
It is the standard client-side deployment when your local stack
is pure WireGuard and only the remote side expects AWG-framed packets.

### Gateway Mode (1:1, `AWG_MODE=gateway`)

Use when the remote side sends AWG and your local backend expects plain WG.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  N[Remote wg2awg client] -->|AWG UDP| P[wg2awg gateway]
  P -->|WG UDP| W[Local WireGuard server]
  W -->|WG UDP| P
  P -->|AWG UDP| N
```

Gateway mode is the opposite mapping of client mode
for a single upstream backend.
It is commonly used on gateway/server side to terminate AWG-facing traffic
and feed a plain WireGuard service behind it.

### Server Mode (1:N, `AWG_MODE=server`)

Use when many AWG clients share one local WireGuard server.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  C1[Client mode peer 1] -->|AWG UDP| H[wg2awg server]
  C2[Client mode peer 2] -->|AWG UDP| H
  C3[Client mode peer N] -->|AWG UDP| H
  H -->|WG UDP| W[Local WireGuard server]
  W -->|WG UDP| H
  H -->|AWG UDP via session table| C1
  H -->|AWG UDP via session table| C2
  H -->|AWG UDP via session table| C3
```

Server mode extends gateway behavior with per-client session routing.
It tracks WireGuard sender/receiver indices and maps responses back to the
correct AWG client when multiple clients share one backend WG endpoint.

Notes:

* Server mode keeps a fixed session table (`4096` slots).
* Peer list limit for explicit server peers is `256`.
* Session routing uses WireGuard sender/receiver indices.

## Protocol Selection

Profile is selected automatically from effective settings:

* v2: any of `S3`, `S4`, or `H1..H4` ranges are used.
* v1.5: no v2 markers, but any `I1..I5` CPS template is set.
* v1: none of the above.

## Release Artifacts and Installation

[Latest release page](https://github.com/WoozyMasta/wg2awg/releases/latest).
Releases provide three artifact families per architecture:

* Static Linux binary: `wg2awg-<arch>`.
* OCI archive: `wg2awg-<arch>-oci.tar.gz`.
* Docker archive: `wg2awg-<arch>-docker.tar.gz`.

Container registries:

* GHCR: <https://github.com/WoozyMasta/wg2awg/pkgs/container/wg2awg>
* Docker Hub: <https://hub.docker.com/r/woozymasta/wg2awg/tags>

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/woozymasta/wg2awg:latest
docker pull docker.io/woozymasta/wg2awg:latest
```

Architectures built by this repo (with practical hardware examples):

* `arm64`: modern 64-bit ARM routers, SBCs, and appliances.
  Typical families include MediaTek Filogic devices, Qualcomm IPQ60xx/IPQ80xx
  lines, and many newer OpenWrt-capable routers.
  RouterOS container-capable devices are commonly here as well.
* `arm`: 32-bit ARMv7 router and embedded families.
  Common on older ARM router lines and some RouterOS ARM boards.
* `armv5`: legacy ARMv5 targets.
  Mostly older low-power embedded and IoT-class Linux hardware.
* `amd64`: x86_64 systems.
  Mini PCs, NUC-class boxes, hypervisor/VM routers, and bare-metal servers.
  Also relevant for RouterOS x86/CHR container workflows.
* `mips`: big-endian MIPS targets (mostly legacy).
  Seen on older router and embedded network device families.
* `mipsel`: little-endian MIPS targets, still common in router fleets.
  Common SoC families include MediaTek, Broadcom, and Qualcomm/Atheros lines,
  depending on device generation and vendor.
  Typical vendor lines in OpenWrt target sets include TP-Link, D-Link,
  Keenetic, Zyxel, Linksys, Netgear, ASUS, and others.
* `mips64le`: 64-bit little-endian MIPS targets.
  Mostly niche embedded/industrial Linux systems.
* `ppc64le`: PowerPC 64-bit little-endian systems.
  Mostly industrial/server environments, uncommon for home routing.
* `386`: legacy 32-bit x86 systems.
  Older x86 routers, thin clients, and embedded PC-class hardware.

Notes:

* Device examples are indicative, not exhaustive.
* The actual artifact to use is determined by your runtime architecture
  (`uname -m`) and userland ABI.
* For model-level support, always verify by exact hardware revision
  in firmware compatibility databases.

Firmware ecosystem hints (for deployment planning):

* OpenWrt:
  Strong coverage across vendor lines and SoC targets;
  useful for TP-Link, D-Link, Zyxel, Keenetic, Netgear, Linksys, ASUS,
  and many ODM derivatives.
* RouterOS:
  Container package support is architecture-limited;
  practical container targets are primarily ARM/ARM64/x86.
* FreshTomato:
  Focused on Broadcom-based ARM and MIPS hardware families.

Practical usage:

* Use the binary on Linux hosts and Linux routers.
* Use OCI archives where your runtime imports OCI layout directly.
* Use Docker archives for runtimes/import flows
  that expect docker-archive layout.

Why two container archive formats:

* `oci.tar.gz` and `docker.tar.gz` contain the same application image,
  but in different archive layouts accepted by different import tools.
* Some container runtimes and RouterOS versions accept only one layout.
  If one format fails to import, use the other.

RouterOS guidance:

* RouterOS v7.18 and newer: prefer `oci.tar.gz` (native OCI import path).
* RouterOS before v7.18: use `docker.tar.gz` as compatibility fallback.
* On non-RouterOS platforms, prefer OCI first;
  use docker-archive only when your toolchain explicitly requires it.

When to use the raw binary:

* Use `wg2awg-<arch>` when you run directly on Linux without containers.
* Typical cases: OpenWrt/custom router firmware, systemd services,
  or minimal hosts where container runtime is unavailable or unnecessary.

## Configuration Model

### Sources and Priority

Effective config is merged in this order:

1. Built-in defaults.
1. Environment variables.
1. Config file values from `-c/--config` or `AWG_CONFIG`.
1. CLI log-level (`-l/--log-level`) over `AWG_LOG_LEVEL`.

Extra key precedence rules:

* `AWG_PRIVATE_KEY` derives `AWG_CLIENT_PUB`.
* If both are set, explicit `AWG_CLIENT_PUB` wins.
* If config file has `PrivateKey`, it overrides env-derived client key.

### Config File Support

Input format: WireGuard/AmneziaWG INI-style file.

`[Interface]` fields parsed:

* `PrivateKey` -> derives client public key.
* `ListenPort` -> converted to `0.0.0.0:<port>`.
* `DNS`.
* `Jc`, `Jmin`, `Jmax`,
  `S1`, `S2`, `S3`, `S4`,
  `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `H4`,
  `I1`, `I2`, `I3`, `I4`, `I5`.

`[Peer]` fields parsed:

* `PublicKey`.
* `Endpoint`.

Behavior with multiple peers:

* First peer `PublicKey`/`Endpoint` populate main remote peer fields.
* All peer public keys are collected for server-mode peer matching.

Important parser nuance:

* Config file `H1..H4` support both single numeric values and `MIN-MAX` ranges.
* `ListenPort` from config still maps to `0.0.0.0:<port>` (IPv4 wildcard).

### CLI Flags

* `-c`, `--config <path>`: load config file.
* `-l`, `--log-level <none|error|info|debug>`.
* `-h`, `--help`.
* `-v`, `--version`.

### Parameter Mapping from WG/AWG Config

This proxy can consume a standard WireGuard/AmneziaWG INI file. Fields map to
runtime options as follows:

* `[Interface].PrivateKey` -> local client key, converted to client public key
  (same role as `AWG_PRIVATE_KEY`).
* `[Interface].ListenPort` -> `AWG_LISTEN` as `0.0.0.0:<port>`.
* `[Interface].DNS` -> resolver list written to `/etc/resolv.conf`.
* `[Interface].Jc/Jmin/Jmax/S1/S2/H1/H2/H3/H4` -> AWG obfuscation settings.
* First `[Peer].PublicKey` -> remote server key (`AWG_SERVER_PUB`).
* First `[Peer].Endpoint` -> `AWG_REMOTE`.
* All `[Peer].PublicKey` entries -> server-mode explicit peer list.

The config file has higher priority than environment variables.

### Environment Variables (Reference)

#### Core Routing and Mode

* `AWG_LISTEN`
  Local UDP socket where `wg2awg` accepts packets from its immediate peer.
  In `client`, this is usually the local WireGuard client endpoint.
  In `gateway/server`, this is the AWG-facing ingress port.
* `AWG_REMOTE`
  Upstream UDP destination used by the proxy.
  In `client`, it must point to the remote AWG server.
  In `gateway/server`, it must point to the local plain WireGuard backend.
* `AWG_MODE` (`client`, `gateway`, `server`; default `client`)
  Selects transformation direction and routing logic.
  `server` enables session-table based demultiplexing for many clients.
* `AWG_SRC_PORT` (`auto` or numeric; default `auto`)
  Source UDP port for the remote-facing socket.
  Numeric value binds a fixed source port.
  `auto` is dynamic in `client`: proxy tracks client source port and reconnects
  remote socket when client port changes, preserving NAT symmetry.

#### Identity, Keys, and Peer Resolution

* `AWG_SERVER_PUB`
  Base64 public key of the server-side WireGuard peer.
  Used to derive MAC1 key for handshake rewriting in the active direction.
* `AWG_CLIENT_PUB`
  Base64 public key of the client-side WireGuard peer.
  Used to derive MAC1 key for the opposite direction.
* `AWG_PRIVATE_KEY`
  Base64 private key (32 bytes) used only to derive `AWG_CLIENT_PUB`.
  If both are provided, explicit `AWG_CLIENT_PUB` overrides derived value.
* `AWG_CLIENT_PUBS`
  Comma/space/newline-separated client public keys for `server` mode.
  Used to resolve which client a WireGuard response belongs to.
* `AWG_CLIENT_PUBS_FILE`
  Same as `AWG_CLIENT_PUBS`, but read from file.
  Size is limited to 1 MiB; duplicate keys are ignored.
* `AWG_CONFIG`
  Path to INI config file. Equivalent to `-c`.

#### AWG Framing and Obfuscation Parameters

* `AWG_JC`
  Number of junk UDP packets sent before an outbound handshake-init.
  `0` disables junk pre-burst.
* `AWG_JMIN`, `AWG_JMAX`
  Min/max junk packet size in bytes.
  Junk sizes are randomized per packet in this range.
* `AWG_S1`
  Extra bytes prepended to WireGuard handshake-init packets.
  Applies only to type-1 handshake packets.
* `AWG_S2`
  Extra bytes prepended to WireGuard handshake-response packets.
  Applies only to type-2 handshake packets.
* `AWG_S3`
  Extra bytes prepended to WireGuard cookie-reply packets (v2 behavior).
  Applies only to type-3 packets.
* `AWG_S4`
  Extra bytes prepended to WireGuard transport-data packets (v2 behavior).
  Applies to data packets and changes transport packet length profile.
* `AWG_H1`, `AWG_H2`, `AWG_H3`, `AWG_H4`
  Replacement values for WireGuard message type field:
  `H1` -> handshake-init, `H2` -> handshake-response,
  `H3` -> cookie-reply, `H4` -> transport-data.
  Accepts either a fixed value (`123`) or range (`100-200`) in env and config.
  Ranges must not overlap after merge.
* `AWG_I1` .. `AWG_I5`
  CPS packet templates emitted before handshake-init.
  Supported segments in one template:
  `<b 0xHEX>` static bytes, `<r N>` random bytes, `<rc N>` random letters,
  `<rd N>` random digits, `<t>` unix timestamp (be32), `<c>` counter (be32).
  Example: `<b 0x48656c6c6f><r 8><t><c>`.

#### Proxy-to-Proxy Outer Obfuscation

`AWG_OBFS_PROFILE` option enables an additional external layer
of traffic obfuscation.

> [!NOTE]
> Works only in the `wg2awg <-> wg2awg` configuration;
> the same profile must be enabled on both sides.

* `off`: no outer wrapper, minimum overhead.
* `stun_ice`: STUN-like envelope with small size jitter.
* `dtls_record`: DTLS-record-like framing.
* `rtp_media`: RTP-like header with sequence/timestamp dynamics.
* `source_query`: Source-query-like prefix/frame.
* `raknet`: RakNet-like packet id + nonce frame.
* `quic_short`: QUIC-short-like header with variable DCID/PN/padding.
* `game_enet`: ENet-like command batch with variable command count.
* `game_kcp`: KCP-like segment fields with small pad jitter.
* `dns_like`: DNS-query-like header and qname envelope.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is not AmneziaWG framing and is incompatible
> with direct WireGuard/AmneziaWG nodes.

#### Reconnect and Runtime Behavior

* `AWG_TIMEOUT` (seconds, default `180`)
  Full inactivity timeout.
  If neither direction sees traffic for this interval, proxy reconnects remote
  socket (close + resolve + connect).
* `AWG_REMOTE_SILENT_TIMEOUT` (seconds, default `300`)
  One-sided silence timeout.
  If local client keeps sending but remote side stays silent for this interval,
  proxy forces reconnect. This is mainly useful for stale DNS/route recovery.
* `AWG_CONNECT_RETRIES` (default `0`)
  Startup-only connect retry count.
  `0` means unlimited retries before daemon enters steady state.
  After startup, runtime reconnect loop always retries with backoff.
* `AWG_DNS`
  Comma-separated resolvers written to `/etc/resolv.conf`.
  Affects hostname resolution for `AWG_REMOTE`.
  Config file `DNS` has precedence over env.

#### Socket and Performance Controls

* `AWG_SOCKET_BUF` (bytes, default `16777216`)
  Requested `SO_RCVBUF` and `SO_SNDBUF` for listen and remote sockets.
  Higher values reduce drop risk on bursty links at cost of RAM.
* `AWG_NO_GRO` (`0`/`1`, default `0`)
  Disables UDP GRO usage when set to `1`.
  With `0`, proxy tries GRO first and auto-falls back if GRO does not coalesce.
* `AWG_CPU_C2S`, `AWG_CPU_S2C` (default `-1`)
  Optional Linux thread affinity for c2s and s2c threads.
  `-1` keeps scheduler default behavior.
* `AWG_BUSY_POLL` (microseconds, default `0`)
  Enables `SO_BUSY_POLL` when positive.
  Can reduce latency under load, usually with higher CPU cost.

#### Logging

* `AWG_LOG_LEVEL` (`none`, `error`, `info`, `debug`; default `info`)
  Controls output verbosity.
  Parsing is first-letter based internally (`n/e/i/d`), so full words should
  be used for clarity.

## Validation Limits

The proxy enforces these hard checks (`config_validate`):

* `JC >= 0`.
* `JMIN >= 0`, `JMAX >= 0`, `JMAX < 65535`, `JMAX >= JMIN` when `JMAX > 0`.
* `S1` in `[0, 1352]`.
* `S2` in `[0, 1408]`.
* `S3` in `[0, 1436]`.
* `S4` in `[0, 1500]`.
* `H1..H4` ranges must not overlap.

From `amneziawg-linux-kernel-module` reference docs, practical ranges are:

* `JC`: usually `4..12`.
* `JMIN/JMAX`: small values (for example `8` and `80`) for low overhead.
* `S1/S2`: often `15..150`.
* `H1..H4`: unique values.

Treat these as operational guidance, not hard limits in this proxy.

## Deployment Examples

### Linux Host with Docker (client mode)

With env vars:

```bash
docker run --rm --network host \
  -e AWG_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:51820 \
  -e AWG_REMOTE=vpn.example.com:443 \
  -e AWG_SERVER_PUB='<server_pub_base64>' \
  -e AWG_CLIENT_PUB='<client_pub_base64>' \
  -e AWG_JC=7 -e AWG_JMIN=32 -e AWG_JMAX=324 \
  -e AWG_S1=0 -e AWG_S2=7 \
  -e AWG_H1=1250212372 -e AWG_H2=322115822 \
  -e AWG_H3=412530544 -e AWG_H4=654563364 \
  ghcr.io/woozymasta/wg2awg:latest
```

Config-file variant:

```bash
docker run --rm --network host \
  -v "$(pwd)/wg0.conf:/etc/wg2awg/wg0.conf:ro" \
  -e AWG_CONFIG=/etc/wg2awg/wg0.conf \
  ghcr.io/woozymasta/wg2awg:latest
```

### MikroTik RouterOS (client mode)

1. Enable container support and fetch:

   ```routeros
   /system/device-mode/update container=yes fetch=yes
   ```

1. Create veth + local container subnet + NAT:

   ```routeros
   /interface/veth/add name=veth-awg address=172.18.0.2/30 gateway=172.18.0.1
   /ip/address/add address=172.18.0.1/30 interface=veth-awg
   /ip/firewall/nat/add chain=srcnat action=masquerade src-address=172.18.0.0/30
   ```

1. Configure WireGuard peer endpoint to local proxy (`172.18.0.2:51820`).
1. Create container env list with AWG parameters from your exported `.conf`.
   Minimal example:

   ```routeros
   /container/envs/add list=wg2awg-env key=AWG_LISTEN value=0.0.0.0:51820
   /container/envs/add list=wg2awg-env key=AWG_REMOTE value=vpn.example.com:443
   /container/envs/add list=wg2awg-env key=AWG_MODE value=client
   ```

   Add the rest of required variables the same way
   (`AWG_SERVER_PUB`, `AWG_CLIENT_PUB`, and your AWG profile values).
1. Import and run image archive:

   ```routeros
   /container/add file=wg2awg-arm64-oci.tar.gz interface=veth-awg \
      envlist=wg2awg-env root-dir=disk1/wg2awg logging=yes
   /container/start [find where interface=veth-awg]
   ```

#### Config-file alternative, instead of many env vars

Mount a single config file and pass only `AWG_CONFIG` in env list.

```routeros
/container/envs/add list=wg2awg-env key=AWG_CONFIG value=/etc/wg2awg/wg0.conf
```

### OpenWrt / Linux Router Pattern

Use the same logical wiring as MikroTik:

* WireGuard peer endpoint points to local `wg2awg` listen socket.
* `wg2awg` remote points to real AWG server endpoint.

Example OpenWrt peer endpoint override:

```sh
uci set network.@wireguard_wg0[0].endpoint_host='127.0.0.1'
uci set network.@wireguard_wg0[0].endpoint_port='51820'
uci commit network
/etc/init.d/network restart
```

For Keenetic/Zyxel-class devices with WireGuard support,
apply the same pattern in CLI or Web UI:

* Local WG peer endpoint -> local proxy address and port.
* Proxy remote -> real AWG endpoint.
* Keep AWG obfuscation values identical on both ends.

## Verification and Operations

Basic checks:

* `wg2awg --version` prints expected release/build version.
* Handshake on WireGuard side updates.
* Proxy logs show client detection and remote connectivity.
* No recurring reconnect loop under stable network.

Useful knobs:

* `AWG_LOG_LEVEL=debug` for packet-path diagnostics.
* `AWG_NO_GRO=1` if your platform has GRO issues.
* `AWG_DNS` or config `DNS` when `AWG_REMOTE` is a hostname.

Common failure causes:

* AWG parameter mismatch (`J*`, `S*`, `H*`).
* Wrong public keys.
* Incorrect local endpoint wiring (WG peer not pointing to proxy).
* Time sync issues on routers (WireGuard is timestamp-sensitive).

## Build and Test from Source

Prerequisites:

* `gcc`, `make` (host tests/build).
* `clang-format`, `clang-tidy` (format and lint).
* Docker with buildx (containerized checks and cross-arch artifacts).

Recommended pre-push gate:

```bash
make container-check
make -j 8 container-test-matrix container-build-matrix
```

This runs:

* `container-check`: containerized full pre-push checks (glibc).
* `container-test-matrix`: runtime test matrix used by CI.
* `container-build-matrix`: full cross-arch artifact build matrix.

### Formatting and Linting

```bash
make fmt
make fmt-check
make lint
```

* `make fmt`: apply `clang-format` to `src/*.c` and `src/*.h`.
* `make fmt-check`: fail if code differs from `.clang-format`.
* `make lint`: run `clang-tidy` on runtime sources (`src/*.c`, non-test).

### Tests

#### Host-based test targets

```bash
make test
make test-hardening
make test-stress
make check-local
```

* `make test`: fast unit and component coverage.
* `make test-hardening`: fuzz-style parser/property checks,
  sanitizer runs (ASAN and UBSAN), and integration smoke scenarios.
* `make test-stress`: long/high-load networking behavior checks.
* `make check-local`: full local gate
  (`fmt-check` + `lint` + `test` + `test-hardening` + `test-stress`).

#### Containerized check target

Based on `Dockerfile.check`

```bash
make container-check-image
```

`make container-check-image`:
run checks in Debian-based check image with configurable scope.

Default scope:

* `fmt-check`
* `lint`
* `test`
* `test-hardening`
* `test-stress`

Useful knobs:

* `CONTAINER_LINT_TARGET` - any make target list passed as one string.

Example (disable stress):

```bash
make container-check-image CONTAINER_CHECK_TARGET="fmt-check lint test test-hardening"
```

#### Containerized test target

Based on `Dockerfile.test`

```bash
make container-test
make container-test CONTAINER_TEST_TARGET=test
```

* `make container-test`: run test container in muslcc image.
* `CONTAINER_TEST_TARGET` controls the make target inside test image
  (default: `test`).
* `Dockerfile.test` also verifies that `make build` succeeds and resulting
  `wg2awg` binary is statically linked.

#### Combined container checks

```bash
make container-check
```

* `make container-check`: run `container-check-image` (full glibc check profile).

### Matrix Tests (Multi-Architecture)

```bash
make container-test-matrix
make container-test-matrix CONTAINER_TEST_TARGET=test
make container-test-full-matrix
make container-test-matrix CONTAINER_TEST_ARCHS="amd64 arm64 arm mips mipsel"
```

* `make container-test-matrix`: run `Dockerfile.test` through buildx across
  `CONTAINER_TEST_ARCHS`.
* `CONTAINER_TEST_ARCHS` defaults to runtime-test set used in CI:
  `amd64 arm64 arm armv5`.
* `make container-test-full-matrix`: full architecture matrix (`ALL_ARCHS`).
* Use a reduced subset for faster pre-checks.

### Build

Native binary:

```bash
make build
```

Container artifacts:

```bash
make container-build-arm64
make container-build-matrix
```

* `make container-build-<arch>`:
  build binary + OCI + Docker archives for one arch.
* `make container-build-matrix`:
  build artifacts for all configured architectures.
* `build.sh` call format:
  `build.sh <platform> <arch-suffix> <muslcc-tag> [version] [build_dir]`.
