## Unreleased

### Added

* Add Morph Mode with per-slot handshake obfuscation derived from a shared
  `MorphKey`, including config/env loading, `-g` key generation, and `-P`
  probe CLI with `-S` slot override.
* Add wg2awg-only `[Interface].ObfsProfile` config support.

### Fixed

* `obfs stun_ice`: `MessageLength` in the STUN header incorrectly included
  padding bytes, causing the unwrapped payload to be `in_len + pad` bytes
  instead of `in_len`; WireGuard rejected the oversized handshake.
* `obfs dns_like`: extra trailing bytes were appended to the wrapped packet but
  not tracked, so unwrap returned a payload that was too long; WireGuard
  rejected the oversized handshake.

## [0.4.0][] - 2026-06-15

### Added

* `AWG_SRC_PORT_DRIFT` (default `1`): on a recovery reconnect,
  rotate the remote source port so a stale NAT mapping left after
  a WAN/PPPoE reconnect is recovered in place, without restarting the container.
  Set `0` to disable.

### Changed

* Lower `AWG_REMOTE_SILENT_EXIT_TIMEOUT` default from `900` to `600` seconds.

### Fixed

* Reliably recover a wedged connection after a WAN/PPPoE reconnect.
* One-sided silence timeout no longer resets on brief client gaps,
  so the exit guard fires as configured.
* Less noisy logs during reconnect.

[0.4.0]: https://github.com/WoozyMasta/wg2awg/compare/0.3.0...0.4.0

## [0.3.0][] - 2026-06-15

### Added

* Add `AWG_REMOTE_SILENT_EXIT_TIMEOUT` (default `900`, `0` disables)
  to exit non-zero after prolonged one-sided remote silence
  so the container runtime can restart the service.
* Log a `WARN` line once one-sided remote silence (client active, remote silent)
  reaches half of the reconnect timeout (`keepalive * 2` by default),
  making WAN/PPPoE reconnect path loss visible in logs before reconnect fires.

### Changed

* `AWG_REMOTE_SILENT_TIMEOUT` now defaults to `auto`:
  derived from the peer `PersistentKeepalive` as `keepalive * 4`,
  with a lower bound of `30` and, when `AWG_REMOTE_SILENT_EXIT_TIMEOUT`
  is enabled, an upper bound of half that value (fallback `60`),
  down from the previous fixed `300`. An explicit value still overrides.

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/WoozyMasta/wg2awg/compare/0.2.1...0.3.0

## [0.2.1][] - 2026-06-11

### Added

* Add CLI flags for mode, listen, remote, and source port overrides.

[0.2.1]: https://github.com/WoozyMasta/wg2awg/compare/0.2.0...0.2.1

## [0.2.0][] - 2026-06-08

### Added

* Add `AWG_DNS_RESOLVE_FAILURE_TIMEOUT` to exit after prolonged consecutive
  DNS resolve failures so container runtime can restart the service.

### Changed

* Log `getaddrinfo()` failure reasons and DNS resolve failure timeout details.

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/WoozyMasta/wg2awg/compare/0.1.0...0.2.0

## [0.1.0][] - 2026-05-24
